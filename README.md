# Python Adaptation of Analysis of Financial Time Series by Dr. Ruey Tsay

## Welcome to my project!

This repository shall contain my attempt to recreate the codes and answer the exercises in the Analysis of Financial Time Series book written in R into Python using the [data](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ruey-s-tsay/research/analysis-of-financial-time-series) made publicly available by Dr. Ruey Tsay. 

This is an on-going project as I would also like to take this opportunity to review the lessons I took in my MS Finance program while reinforcing my Python programming skills.

### ðŸ“Œ The following are among my secondary goals for this project:
1. Create a R script that will convert the raw data into something usable by Python (maybe into CSV) so that everyone can easily make use of the data for their own analysis -- be it for Python or MS Excel or other programming language of their choice that can read CSV files.
2. I plan to write my notes and codes in Jupyter Notebooks to make the organization of the codes easier to read and follow. This is to help future learners of financial time series as well.
